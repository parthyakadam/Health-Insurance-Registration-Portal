# Health Insurance Registration Portal Project

This repository contains a Health Insurance Registration Portal project built from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to provide users with a simple and intuitive platform to register for health insurance policies.
## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can sign up by providing basic personal information, contact details, and selecting insurance preferences.

- **Validation:** Input fields are validated in real-time to ensure accurate and complete information is provided during registration.

- **Responsive Design:** The portal is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

In upcoming future, features like Policy Provider Login, Policy Selection Section, Dynamic Pricing, Payment Gateway, etc. to make it a real-world-deployable application.
## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The project's structure and content are created using HTML, providing the foundation for the user interface.

- **CSS:** Styling is implemented using CSS to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

- **JavaScript:** Interactive features, input validation, and dynamic pricing calculations are achieved through JavaScript.
## Lessons Learned

This was my first project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Though I had theoretical knowledge about these, implementing it in a real time project was a real challange. I had to put a lot of effort in styling each compnent from scratch that too using Vanil CSS without Bootstrap or tailwind css. I reffered sources from Stackoverflow, Youtube, FreeCodeCamp etc. to overcome these challenges.
